# KeyboardControls

KeyboardControls is a special type of controller that allows you to move using your keyboard.

## Usage

### In combination with PointerLockControls

Here you need to use the PointerLockControls with make-default props, KeyboardControls will automatically adapt to it, creating a really good effect first player experiences.

```vue{5}
<template>
  <TresCanvas shadows alpha>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 0, 3]" />
    <PointerLockControls make-default  />
    <KeyboardControls />
    <TresGridHelper :args="[10, 10]" />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

Just by doing this, works great but in addition the TresJs team give some special props (only available with this mode) to create more realistic sensation

- headBobbing: To simulate the walk balance of the head
- Jump: to jump
- gravity: to control the gravity related to the jump

### In combination with slots

Here you can move meshes by using your keyboard, by default you move through the X and Z axis, but you can change it with the is2D prop, to move your meshes on the X and Y axis

```vue{4-8}
<template>
  <TresCanvas shadows alpha>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 0, 3]" />
    <KeyboardControls>
      <Sphere>
        <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
      </Sphere>
    </KeyboardControls>
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

::: warning
Is really important that the Perspective camera is set first in the canvas. Otherwise might break.
